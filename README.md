# Circadian-Rhythm-Monitor

The Rhythm Monitor is an innovative device that offers several advantages over other circadian monitoring devices available on the market. Unlike traditional devices that only measure one or two circadian parameters, the Rhythm Monitor is designed to calculate the Circadian Function Index (CFI) of each circadian parameter, including sleep, light, activity, wrist temperature, and environmental temperature.  

By taking into account multiple parameters, the Rhythm Monitor provides a more comprehensive and accurate picture of an individual's circadian rhythm. The CFI is a powerful tool that has been shown to increase the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of circadian rhythm assessment. It is calculated by analyzing the shape of the circadian pattern for each parameter, which takes into account both the timing and amplitude of the rhythm.  

By quantifying the strength and regularity of each circadian parameter, the CFI provides a more complete understanding of an individual's circadian rhythm and its relationship to other physiological processes. Another advantage of the Rhythm Monitor is its portability and lightweight design.  

The device is small enough to be worn comfortably on the wrist or attached to clothing, making it easy for individuals to monitor their circadian rhythm throughout the day and night. This portability also makes it ideal for use in a variety of settings, including home, work, and travel. In addition to measuring circadian parameters, the Rhythm Monitor also tracks light exposure and environmental temperature.  

This information is crucial for understanding how external factors influence the circadian rhythm. For example, exposure to bright light in the morning can help to reset the circadian clock and improve sleep quality, while exposure to blue light in the evening can disrupt the circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.  

By tracking light exposure and environmental temperature, the Rhythm Monitor provides insights into how the surrounding environment affects an individual's circadian rhythm. The Rhythm Monitor is a valuable tool for individuals looking to better understand their own circadian rhythm and how it affects their health and well-being.
